# Pure Pursuit Controller
## Vehicle kinetic model 
Firstly, we consider the Ackermann turning for kinetic  
![image](https://github.com/CeHao1/Racing_Car/blob/master/Controller/pure%20pursuit/image/1.png)  
The movement can be expressed as

Where, L denotes wheel base and R the turning radius. Î´ denotes steering angle.  
## Pursuit model
Here we need plan a trajectory at first and find the target point, which the vehicle should always pursuit.

The lookahead distance in the graph is ld and the target point is (gx,gy)  
By law of sin, we can deduce the following formula:  
![image](https://github.com/CeHao1/Racing_Car/blob/master/Controller/pure%20pursuit/image/4.png)  
Combine the Ackermann turning formula and pursuit formula, we have:

However, how to define and select the lookahead distance ld is important. The higher velocity, the farther distance should be predicted. Therefore, we introduce the dynamic lookahead distance Lf  
![image](https://github.com/CeHao1/Racing_Car/blob/master/Controller/pure%20pursuit/image/6.png)  
Where, L0 denotes a basic distance and kx denotes a coefficient that amplify the distance according to velocity. If the vehicle runs in higher speed, the lookahead distance will be higher correspondingly.
